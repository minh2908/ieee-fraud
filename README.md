# Kaggle Competition: Detect Fraud from Customer Transactions

In this project, we analyze a large scale dataset released by IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) to detect fraud in customer transactions. By improving the accuracy of detecting fraud in credit card transactions, we can help millions of customers to shop safely and millions of business to reduce loss and increase revenue. The dataset consists of nearly 600,000 transactions with nearly 400 features. Details about the dataset and its documentation can be found on Kaggle.
